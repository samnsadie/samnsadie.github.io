	<p>Thank you for stopping at Sammy Kay Art, I am so glad you came by. I am Sammy Kay, I am a Junior in the Graphic Design program at Grand View Univeristy. I love creating logos, posters, and more. Below you can see some samples of my work. Please take a look around at my art.</p>
	<h4>My Ideal Day:</h4>
	<p>My Ideal day would be sitting outside on a warm 75 degree day, painting a bright and colorful dog. Ideally I would like to incorporate my dog painting into a graphic design piece like I did for the Smiling Dog Logo as shown below.</p>
